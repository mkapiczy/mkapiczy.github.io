                            <p>The requirement elicitation process has been carried out through three meetings with the
                                customer from Mjølner. Each one has lasted one hour. The meetings were split into three
                                topics:

                            <ol>
                                <li>Initial meeting - including goal and domain level requirements. Furthermore we did a
                                    stakeholder analysis and discussed the timeframe for this project along with a
                                    matching of expectations.
                                </li>
                                <li>Second meeting - including review of the first document draft, and discussion on new
                                    requirements. Product and design level requirements were discussed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Last meeting - including a review of the whole SRS, and final comments from the
                                    customer.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>

                            <p>During the periods between the meetings, the group has been working on the SRS, so it was
                                continuously improved, and kept up to date.</p>

                            <p>All deliverables have been submitted to the customer 48 hours in advance of our meetings,
                                so that the customer had a chance to acknowledge with the document, and prepare for the
                                upcoming meeting.</p>

                            <p>FarmCom is a solution designed to extend an existing, currently functioning system, that
                                enables farmers to access a series of services such as a surveillance of their animals,
                                or monitoring farm information such as a temperature, or a number of animals of
                                particular species. These functionalities are now currently available only inside the
                                farm’s internal network. This means that the farmer is able to use farm's services as
                                long as he is connected to the farm’s internal network.</p>

                            <p>However, there was a need for enabling the access to all the services from external
                                networks. Wherefore, the customer expected that the supplier would deliver a COTS system
                                that extends the functionality of existing system and enables the access to the services
                                outside of the farm. Simplified, the overall purpose of the system is to forward a HTTP
                                request from the user’s browser all the way to the specific farm's endpoint and return
                                the response back to the browser.</p>

                            <p>The theoretical solution to this issue might be to just open the port, which enables
                                access to needed services to the outside world, but the customer does not like this
                                solution because it would require massive amount of manual settings on every single
                                farm, and it would be hard to maintain, and control in the future.</p>

                            <p>As a result, the solution presented in the SRS document has been created.</p>
