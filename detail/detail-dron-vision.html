                    <p> The system is called "DronVision". It has been designed for purposes of surveillance and
                        control of big areas, such as industrial
                        or agricultural areas through visualization of area search by drones.</p>


                    <p>The system allows for gathering of real time geoposition data, analysing the data
                        according to invented algorithm, and visualization of the data on mobile devices.</p>

                    <h2>Thesis abstract</h2>
                    <p>The main purpose of this thesis was to map out algorithm for computation and
                        visualization of area registered by cameras mounted to unmanned aerial vehicles,
                        colloquially known as drones, based on vehicles' geopositions and angles of camera
                        lenses. Such an area was described in the research as searched area. Additional aim was
                        to create an information system enabling to gather positional data from aircrafts and
                        visualize effects of the algorithm on mobile devices.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the beginning there were described theoretical aspects connected with touched
                        issues, which contained such topics as global positioning system (GPS), the way it works
                        and its accuracy, reference surfaces for mapping, digital elevation models, and the ways
                        of gathering them with detailed description of shuttle radar topography mission. Being
                        acquainted with these issues was crucial for further stages of the study. The next
                        section focused on system analysis. There were discussed technologies adequate for
                        designed system, available types of applications, platforms, and tools allowing to
                        create software. Furthermore, the ways of communication between system elements were
                        chosen, and the format of transported data was picked out. Thereafter, the study focused
                        on the requirements that the designed system was to meet. The result of this section was
                        a logical model of the system describing ways of realization of defined preconditions
                        and tasks without implementation details. The next chapter was dedicated to the issue of
                        developing the algorithm for computation and visualization of searched area. At the
                        beginning there was performed an analysis of the requirements and foundations related to
                        the algorithm. Afterwards, the complete algorithm was divided into three parts:
                        algorithm for computation of the hull of the area, algorithm for the determination of
                        the areas inside the hull, which were eclipsed by something, and therefore, not
                        registered by the camera, and finally, algorithm for combining areas calculated in
                        consecutive steps into single area. First two algorithms were designed with use of
                        heuristics and the last one harnessed scientific theory of alpha shapes, and algorithm
                        for computation of alpha-concave hull. After system analysis and algorithm description
                        there was time for system design which consisted of the transformation of the analytical
                        model into model containing informations about internal structure of the system, its
                        configurations and implementation. As the effect of this section, static structure
                        diagrams such as component diagram, class diagram, entity relationship diagram, and
                        dynamic models such as activity and sequence diagrams were created. Within the system
                        design stage user interface design for mobile - visualizing application called
                        DronVision was also created. The last part of the study composed of implementation of
                        the designed information system, invented algorithm, and presentation of the conceived
                        solution taking into account apportionment of the whole system into subsystems, and
                        overview of the visualizing application's views. This part may be circumscribed as
                        user's manual for the application DronVision.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a result, the assumptions stated at the beginning of the thesis were met and the tool
                        for cooperation with unmanned aerial vehicles, in the range of visualization of searched
                        areas, was created. The thesis allowed the author to remarkably extend his knowledge in
                        such fields as computer science, mathematics, software engineering, algorithmics,
                        geoinformatics,
                        geophysics, and many others which are hard to classify.
