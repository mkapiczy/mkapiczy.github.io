                            <p class="lead">Robots are definitely advanced designs, but usually (Let's not consider AI
                                scenarios for now) they are only as advanced as they are told to be. Robot Control is an
                                interface for programming robot behaviour.</p>

                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>The project was created as a part of the Programming Language Paradigms course at Aarhus
                                University. Its main goal was to design and implement robot control system made for a
                                factory application.
                            </p>

                            <p>The project was implemented with use of two different programming paradigms:

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Imperative</li>

                            <p>The imperative part is written in Java, and is built as a JavaFX application. This part
                                contains all the GUI logic and uses a Kawa framework for communicating with the
                                functional part.

                                The application is split into several packages in order to separate logic: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>GUI - containing all user interface components and functionality such as
                                    animations.
                                </li>
                                <li>Robot - holding a model of the robot state which is mapped when communicating with
                                    Scheme.
                                <li> Utils - different utilities such as file reader for loading scheme files and
                                    mapping used when displaying the floor.
                                </li>
                                <li>Scheme - containing Scheme communication logic.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>To communicate with Scheme the Kawa framework is used. This framework allows Scheme to
                                run in a Java environment.</p>

                            <li>Functional</li>
                            <p>
                                The Scheme code contains all the functionality of the program regarding robot
                                behaviour, and is based on the functional programming paradigm.

                                The implementation was split into separate files.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The FloorPlan - which holds the state of the floor.</li>
                                <li>FloorUtil - which is used as an accessor to the floor and tiles.</li>
                                <li>Robot - holds information about the robot ”object”, and defines the rules
                                    imposed on its
                                    behaviour
                                </li>
                                <li>Simulation - which runs the simulation and calls procedures of the robot.</li>
                            </ul>

                            </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>As mentioned, Scheme is a functional programming language, and is very good at
                                handling
                                computations.

                                It gave a good separation of concerns, as all logic of the robot is contained in
                                Scheme, and view
                                logic in Java. The robot behaviour has been encapsulated in the class representation
                                being a function
                                containing other functions. The robot class function is immutable meaning that every
                                call changing the
                                robot state resulted in creation of a new robot instance. However, not all of the
                                inside functions are
                                pure functions because some of them depend on the Floor Plan representation, which
                                is in contradiction
                                to functional programming paradigm.</p>

                            <p>The system consists of two independent components: Java and Scheme, communicating with
                                each other. The project was designed with focus on proper separation of concerns between
                                this two components.</p>

                            <p>The Scheme component can be viewed as robot's internal memory, and as a result it
                                contains all robot state, and defines its behaviour based on programmed movement
                                restrictions and floor state.</p>

                            <p>The imperative part is written in Java, and is build as a JavaFX application
                                \cite{javafx}. This component contains all the GUI logic and uses a Kawa framework for
                                communicating with the functional part. This framework allows Scheme to run in a Java
                                environment.</p>

                            <h2>Running the application</h2>
                            <p>In order to run an application simply import it into your IDE with JavaFX configuration,
                                and run it as Java Application. </p>
