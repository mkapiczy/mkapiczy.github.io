                            </div>

                            <p>The project was created as a part of the Programming Language Paradigms course at Aarhus
                                University. Its main goal was to design and implement robot control system made for a
                                factory application.
                            </p>

                            <p>The project was implemented with use of two different programming paradigms:

                                <ol>
                                    <li>imperative (Java)

                            <p>The imperative part is written in Java, and is built as a JavaFX application. This part
                                contains
                                all the GUI logic and uses a Kawa framework for communicating with the functional part.
                                The
                                application is split into several packages in order to separate logic: GUI - containing
                                all user interface
                                components and functionality such as animations. Robot - holding a model of the robot
                                state which is
                                mapped when communicating with Scheme. Utils - different utilities such as file reader
                                for loading
                                scheme files and mapping used when displaying the floor. Scheme - containing Scheme
                                communication
                                logic.

                                To communicate with Scheme the Kawa framework is used. This framework allows Scheme to
                                run
                                in a Java environment.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>functional (Scheme)

                                <p>
                                    The Scheme code contains all the functionality of the program regarding robot
                                    behaviour, and is based
                                    on the functional programming paradigm. The implementation was split into separate
                                    files. The
                                    FloorPlan - which holds the state of the floor. FloorUtil - which is used as an
                                    accessor to the floor
                                    and tiles. Robot - holds information about the robot ”object”, and defines the rules
                                    imposed on its
                                    behaviour. Simulation - which runs the simulation and calls procedures of the robot.
                                    As mentioned, Scheme is a functional programming language, and is very good at
                                    handling
                                    computations.

                                    It gave a good separation of concerns, as all logic of the robot is contained in
                                    Scheme, and view
                                    logic in Java. The robot behaviour has been encapsulated in the class representation
                                    being a function
                                    containing other functions. The robot class function is immutable meaning that every
                                    call changing the
                                    robot state resulted in creation of a new robot instance. However, not all of the
                                    inside functions are
                                    pure functions because some of them depend on the Floor Plan representation, which
                                    is in contradiction
                                    to functional programming paradigm.
                                </p></li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>

                            <p>The system consists of two independent components: Java and Scheme, communicating with
                                each other. The project was designed with focus on proper separation of concerns between
                                this two components.</p>

                            <p>The Scheme component can be viewed as robot's internal memory, and as a result it
                                contains all robot state, and defines its behaviour based on programmed movement
                                restrictions and floor state.</p>

                            <p>The imperative part is written in Java, and is build as a JavaFX application
                                \cite{javafx}. This component contains all the GUI logic and uses a Kawa framework for
                                communicating with the functional part. This framework allows Scheme to run in a Java
                                environment.</p>
